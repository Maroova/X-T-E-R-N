Analysis Explaination:

The food trucks were chosen according to the highest rating. The APIs used were Google Places and Google Distance Matrix. Text analysis was done to determine the cuisine. The distribution of the food trucks and the order were done according to the Distance Matrix, where the the closest vendors were organized to be in the same day, using the shortest route. In the future, extensive visualization can be done through PowerBI or additional packages in R.
